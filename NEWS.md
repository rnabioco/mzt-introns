## Rissland project

## Goals:
  - develop methods for classifying transcripts into maternal or zygotic during the MZT 
  - use the presence of intronic read coverage to indicate `de-novo` transcription
  - apply first to well studied organisms (drosophila, zebrafish), then use as method for less well characterized systems, such as sea urchin. 
  
## 2018-02-15 Make pipeline species agnostic 
  - reorganize pipeline to handle additional species
  - download zebrafish and xenopus datasets from GEO
  
## 2018-02-14 Finish drosophila characterization
  - Pick sensible cutoffs for zygotic and maternal
  - Plot as heatmaps, ordering by time to first expression for strictly zygotic
  - extract out sequences and look for zelda enrichment
  
## 2018-02-06 Reorganize results
  - current results and pipeline is mess
  - regorganize into dates and keep running log of work
  - determine if zygotic transcripts are enriched for zelda binding sites (7-mer)
  - put code on github repo
